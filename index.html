          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>After graduating University of Toronto, I took Interactive Media
              Management program at George Brown College where I learned
              how to design interactive media. By combining my development
              skills I learned from University and Bitmaker Lab, I was able to
              create websites of my own.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I try my best to create unique and innovative website that fits the needs by investigating interaction between user and the goal. I strongly think that the future of the website will not simply be
              in the monitor nor cell phone but in combination with other technologies such as near-field communication,            
              augmented reality and virtual reality.

                                <p>While working at Intellisoft Development, I have developed and maintained contents and functionality for George Brown College website. I have encountered new technologies such as ASP.Net, WCAG and SASS that were incorporated with the tasks I was given. The tasks involved mostly front-end work using JavaScript and its frameworks. One of the interesting tasks I was given was where the user being able to download specific selection of files into one zipped file format. The solution I have used was System.IO.Compression library and ajax calls using jQuery.

                                Tree of Knowledge was exhibited in Digifest 2017. It is an immersive learning tool for children to gain knowledge about the world. Users pick up various shapes, from animals to stars, of wooden piece from tree structure, then place the piece on a stage to solve interesting questions. My job on this project was to plan, lead and develop all technological parts. Near-field communication technology was chosen to initiate the page on an iPad app, then the app passed corresponding Javascript codes to the site to view the right page to the user. As the most NFC frameworks are focused on android or apple app developments, I developed an iPad app which loads the website in Kiosk mode then passes Javascript code to load the corresponding page.

                                  AutoBin is a recycling app targeted towards Canadians who have different biweekly/weekly waste collection schedule depending on where you live. The app not only notify the user the correct schedule but also tracks how much he or she has correctly placed waste into a correct container. Depending on how much the user have correctly put waste in, it transfers into credits which he or she can use in the community such as garbage bin upgrade or fee waive. The app uses an assumption that the garbage truck has a bulit-in technology where it can track how much individual household is correctly disposing the garbage. inVision was used to build the prototype of this app.

                                  HappyTribe is volunteering registration app for both hosts and volunteers. The app is a solution to a problem which the users are having hard time trying to find a volunteering event and track changes to the information and capacity of the event. The core function of the site involves sign-up, mailing, messaging and reservation. My task on this project was to develop the website with other members of the team using git version control tool. The site was developed using Ruby on Rails and various JavaScript library such as hammer.js and jQuery mobile. A lot of feedback between the members went back and forth in a limited time.
